# Elliptic Curve Point Generator and Visualizer

This Shiny app allows users to explore elliptic curves over finite fields, providing an interactive way to visualize and understand elliptic curve arithmetic. Users can define a curve, select a generator point, and iteratively compute and map points generated by elliptic curve addition. The app is designed with a dark, grunge, punk aesthetic combined with futuristic elements.

## Features

- **Customizable Curve Parameters**: Input parameters \( a \), \( b \), and a prime \( p \) to define the elliptic curve \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p \).
- **Discriminant Check**: Ensures the curve is non-singular by verifying \( 4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0 \mod p \).
- **Point Visualization**: Displays all valid points on the elliptic curve.
- **Interactive Generator Exploration**:
  - Select a generator point \( G \) and visualize its iterations (\( kG \)).
  - Tracks and highlights the journey of generated points with connecting paths.

## Usage

1. **Define a Curve**: Input values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( p \) (prime number).
2. **Visualize Points**: Click "Select Curve" to generate and display all valid points on the curve.
3. **Select a Generator**: Choose a generator point \( G \) from the dropdown menu.
4. **Explore Points**: Use "Start Generating" to begin, and "Next Point" to iteratively compute and map new points.
5. **Reset as Needed**: Clicking start again will reset the process.
